Idea:

Actually, the main idea and plan are improve by everyone of us, it is really hard to divide the idea by each teammate.

Implemntation:

Lichen Zhang lxz489: I responsed for building the unitState class which used to save the information of the unit, and I also complete the basic part of the Alpha-beta Pruning Algorithms, however, because we don't finish the getChildren() function, it is not completed.

Jianzhe Zhang: I responsed for finishing the GameState, in this GameState I read the information of the current state, for example, unit HP, Postion and resourse. 

Larry Liu: I repsonsed for implementing the Utility function, in that function I use the Astar algorithms to find the path between the two units (ours and enemy's), and we try to consist a utility function, it seems good but let us see what happen if we implemented all things.

Period 2:

Things looks harder than our expection, it is really big project. Our contribution is below:

Lichen Zhang lxz489: This time I finish the heruristic function and how to take a childState by a utility value, it is important for minimax.

Jianzhe Zhang: I responsed for finishing lots of tiny functions, the most important one is Utility function, we update it and add new factor. I also build the inner function for the new state.

Larry Liu: I repsonsed for implementing the action part, it is really huge work. Currently the footman can chase the archers, however, it won't attack them although the distance is very close, we will try to figure out it and we suppose it would be work.

Period 3:

Finnally we fix the bug and did it, it can figure out the three given maps successfully!

In the final period, our contribution is here:

Lichen Zhang lxz489: Test and figure out the new copy functions.

Jianzhe Zhang: Consider the improvement of heuristic functions.

Larry Liu: Finaly debug and test, combine the function and tidy the cod.
